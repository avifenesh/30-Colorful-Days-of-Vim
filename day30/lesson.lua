Welcome to Day 30 of your Vim challenge!

Congratulations on making it this far! Today, we'll focus on advanced topics and review.

New concepts for today:
    - `:help <topic>`: Get help on a specific topic.
    - `:map`: List all key mappings.
    - `:map <lhs> <rhs>`: Create a key mapping.
    - `:unmap <lhs>`: Remove a key mapping.

Reminder from Day 29:
    - Abbreviations (`:iabbrev`, `:cabbrev`).

Your tasks:
1.  Explore the help documentation for a command you're curious about.
2.  Create a key mapping for a frequently used command (e.g., map `<leader>w` to `:w`).
3.  Unmap a key mapping.

This is the final day! Keep practicing, and you'll become a Vim master!
