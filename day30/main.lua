Welcome to Day 30 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `:help <topic>`: Get help on a specific topic.
    - `:map`: List all key mappings.
    - `:map <lhs> <rhs>`: Create a key mapping.
    - `:unmap <lhs>`: Remove a key mapping.

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 29: Abbreviations - `:iabbrev`, `:cabbrev` (create shortcuts)
    Day 19: Custom commands - `:command` (create complex mappings)
    Day 15: Command history - `q:` (review and learn from your command history)
    Day 8: Macros - `qa`, `@a` (record complex sequences - great to map!)
    Day 1-30: Everything! - Time to combine all you've learned!


Your tasks:
1.  Explore the help documentation for a command you're curious about.
2.  Create a key mapping for a frequently used command (e.g., map `<leader>w` to `:w`).
3.  Unmap a key mapping.
