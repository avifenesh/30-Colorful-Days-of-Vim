Welcome to Day 18 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `:autocmd`: Define an auto-command.
    - `:autocmd BufWritePost *.lua echo "Lua file saved!"`: Example auto-command.

Reminder from Day 17:
    - Registers (`"a`, `"_`, `"0`).


Your tasks:
1.  Create an auto-command that prints "File opened!" every time a Lua file is opened.
2.  Create an auto-command that prints "File saved!" every time a Lua file is saved.
