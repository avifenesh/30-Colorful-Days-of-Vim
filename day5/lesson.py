Welcome to Day 5 of your Vim challenge!

Today we'll learn about visual mode and selecting text.

New keys for today:
    - `v`: Enter visual mode (character-wise).
    - `V`: Enter visual mode (line-wise).
    - `ctrl-v`: Enter visual mode (block-wise).
    - `d`: Delete the selected text.
    - `y`: Yank (copy) the selected text.
    - `~`: Change the case of the selected text.

Reminder from Day 4:
    - `.` to repeat, and using counts like `3w`.

Your tasks:
1.  Select and delete the lines with the comments "# TASK 1".
2.  Select the text "hello world" in the line with the comment "# TASK 2" and change its case.
3.  Select the first character of each line from "# TASK 3" to the end of the file and delete them.
