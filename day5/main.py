Welcome to Day 5 of your Vim challenge!

CHARACTER NAVIGATION - Master precise cursor movement!

New keys for today:
    - `f{char}`: Find (jump to) next occurrence of {char} on current line
    - `F{char}`: Find previous occurrence of {char} on current line
    - `t{char}`: Till (jump before) next occurrence of {char}
    - `T{char}`: Till previous occurrence of {char}
    - `;`: Repeat last f/F/t/T in same direction
    - `,`: Repeat last f/F/t/T in opposite direction
    - `%`: Jump to matching bracket/parenthesis/brace
    - `*`: Search for word under cursor forward
    - `#`: Search for word under cursor backward
    - `/`: Search forward (basic introduction)
    - `?`: Search backward (basic introduction)

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 4: Yank/paste/undo - `yy`, `p`, `P`, `u`, `Ctrl-r`
    Day 3: Delete/change - `dw`, `cw`, `dd`, `cc`, `D`, `C`
    Day 2: Advanced navigation - `gg`, `G`, `Ctrl-d/u`, `H/M/L`
    Day 1: Basic movement - `w`, `b`, `e`, `0`, `$`

Your tasks:
1. Use f/F to navigate to specific characters
2. Use t/T for precise positioning before characters
3. Use % to fix matching brackets
4. Use * and # to find repeated words
5. Combine character navigation with delete/change
