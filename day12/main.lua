    - `:g/pattern/s/old/new/g`: Replace "old" with "new" on all lines containing "pattern".

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 11: Marks - `ma` (set mark a), `'a` (jump to line), `` `a `` (jump to position)
    Day 9: Text objects - `iw`, `aw`, `i"`, `a"`, `i(`, `a(` (combine with d, c, y!)
    Day 7: Replace - `:%s/old/new/g` (works great with :g!)
    Day 6: Visual mode - `v`, `V`, `Ctrl-v` (visual block)
    Day 5: Search - `/pattern`, `n`, `N`, `*`, `#`


Your tasks:
1.  Delete all lines containing the word "delete".

3.  On lines containing "replace", replace the word "old" with "new".
