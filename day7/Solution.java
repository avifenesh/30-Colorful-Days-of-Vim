/*
Welcome to Day 7 of your Vim challenge!

Today we'll learn about searching and replacing.

New keys for today:
    - `/text`: Search for "text".
    - `?text`: Search backwards for "text".
    - `n`: Go to the next match.
    - `N`: Go to the previous match.
    - `:%s/old/new/g`: Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new".
    - `:%s/old/new/gc`: Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" with confirmation.

Reminder from Day 6:
    - `>>` and `<<` for indentation.

Your tasks:
1.  Search for the word "Vim" and replace it with "Neovim".
2.  Replace all occurrences of the word "wrong" with "right".
