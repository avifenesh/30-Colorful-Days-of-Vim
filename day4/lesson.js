/*
Welcome to Day 4 of your Vim challenge!

Today we'll learn about repeating commands and using counts.

New keys for today:
    - `.`: Repeat the last change.
    - `3w`: Move forward 3 words.
    - `5j`: Move down 5 lines.
    - `2dd`: Delete 2 lines.
    - `3x`: Delete 3 characters.

Reminder from Day 3:
    - `yy`, `p`, `P` for yanking and putting.

Your tasks:
1.  Delete the three lines with the comments "// TASK 1".
2.  On the line with the comment "// TASK 2", delete the word "one" and then use the repeat command to delete "two" and "three".

// TASK 2:

console.log("Vim challenge Day 4!");
