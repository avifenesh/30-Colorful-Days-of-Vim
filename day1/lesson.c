/*
Welcome to Day 1 of your Vim challenge!

Today's lesson focuses on more efficient movement and simple edits.

New keys for today:
    - `w`: Move forward one word at a time.
    - `b`: Move backward one word at a time.
    - `e`: Move to the end of the current word.
    - `0`: Move to the beginning of the current line.
    - `$`: Move to the end of the current line.
    - `~`: Change the case of the character under the cursor.
    - `r`: Replace the character under the cursor.

Your tasks:
1.  Navigate to the line with the comment "// TASK 1" and change the case of the first letter of each word in the line.
2.  Navigate to the line with the comment "// TASK 2" and replace the placeholder 'X' with the correct number.
3.  In the "main" function, navigate to the line with the comment "// TASK 3" and change the word "wrong" to "right".
