"""
Welcome to Day 17 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `"ay`: Yank into register 'a'.
    - `"ap`: Paste from register 'a'.
    - `"_d`: Delete to black hole register (don't save to any register).
    - `"0p`: Paste the last yanked text (from register 0).

Reminder from Day 16:
    - `zf`, `za`, `zc`, `zo` for folding.


Your tasks:
1.  Yank the line with "# TASK 1" into register 'a'.
2.  Yank the line with "# TASK 2" into register 'b'.
3.  Paste the content of register 'a' below "# TASK 3".
4.  Paste the content of register 'b' below "# TASK 4".
