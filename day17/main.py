"""
Welcome to Day 17 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `"ay`: Yank into register 'a'.
    - `"ap`: Paste from register 'a'.
    - `"_d`: Delete to black hole register (don't save to any register).
    - `"0p`: Paste the last yanked text (from register 0).

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 16: Folding - `zfap` (fold paragraph), `za` (toggle), `zc`/`zo` (close/open)
    Day 11: Marks - `ma` (set mark a), `'a` (jump to line), `` `a `` (jump to position)
    Day 8: Macros - `qa` (record to a), `@a` (play) - works with registers!
    Day 3: Yank/paste - `yy`, `p`, `P` (default register)
    Day 2: Delete - `dd`, `dw`, `d$` (saves to default register)


Your tasks:
1.  Yank the line with "# TASK 1" into register 'a'.
2.  Yank the line with "# TASK 2" into register 'b'.
3.  Paste the content of register 'a' below "# TASK 3".
4.  Paste the content of register 'b' below "# TASK 4".
