"""
Welcome to Day 11 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about marks.

New keys for today:
    - `ma`: Set mark 'a' at the current cursor position.
    - `` `a ``: Jump to mark 'a'.
    - `` 'a ``: Jump to the beginning of the line where mark 'a' was set.
    - `` `. ``: Jump to the last change.
    - `` `' ``: Jump to the beginning of the line of the last change.

Reminder from Day 10:
    - `:e`, `:ls`, `:b`, `:bn`, `:bp` for working with buffers.

Your tasks:
1.  Set a mark at the beginning of the line with "# TASK 1".
2.  Move to the line with "# TASK 2".
3.  Jump back to the mark you set and delete the line.
"""

# TASK 1: This line should be deleted.

# TASK 2: Move to this line.
