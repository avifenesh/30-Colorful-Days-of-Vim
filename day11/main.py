Welcome to Day 11 of your Vim challenge!

ADVANCED TEXT OBJECTS - Master paragraph, sentence, and tag selection!

New text objects for today:
    - `ip`: Inner paragraph (paragraph content)
    - `ap`: A paragraph (including blank lines)
    - `is`: Inner sentence
    - `as`: A sentence (including trailing space)
    - `it`: Inner tag (HTML/XML content)
    - `at`: A tag (including tags themselves)
    - `i>` / `i<`: Inner angle brackets
    - `a>` / `a<`: A angle brackets
    - `i` ` `: Inner backticks
    - `a` ` `: A backticks

Advanced combinations:
    - `dip`: Delete inner paragraph
    - `cis`: Change inner sentence
    - `yat`: Yank entire HTML tag
    - `vi` ` `: Visual select inside backticks
    - `2dip`: Delete 2 paragraphs
    - `das`: Delete a sentence

Pro tips:
    - Paragraphs are separated by blank lines
    - Sentences end with . ! or ? followed by space/newline
    - Tags work with HTML/XML structure
    - Can be combined with counts

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 10: Basic text objects - `iw`, `aw`, `i"`, `a"`, `i(`, `a(`
    Day 9: Repeat/counts - `.`, `3w`, `2dd`
    Day 8: Search/replace - `/`, `?`, `:s`, `:%s`
    Day 7: Visual mode - `v`, `V`, `Ctrl-v`

Your tasks:
1. Master paragraph text objects
2. Work with sentence objects
3. Handle HTML/XML tags
4. Practice with code blocks
5. Combine with counts
6. Real-world scenarios
