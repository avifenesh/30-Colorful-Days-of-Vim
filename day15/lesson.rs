/*
Welcome to Day 15 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about the command-line window and history.

New commands for today:
    - `q:`: Open the command-line window for command history.
    - `q/`: Open the command-line window for search history.
    - `Ctrl-f`: Enter the command-line window from command mode.

Reminder from Day 14:
    - `Ctrl-n`, `Ctrl-p` for auto-completion.

Your tasks:
1.  Open the command-line window and find a previous command you executed.
2.  Execute a search command (e.g., `/fn`) and then open the search history to re-execute it.
