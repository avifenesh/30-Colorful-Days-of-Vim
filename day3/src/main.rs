/*
Welcome to Day 3 of your Vim challenge!

DELETE & CHANGE - Master text modification operations!

New keys for today:
    - `dw`: Delete word (from cursor to start of next word)
    - `db`: Delete backward word
    - `de`: Delete to end of word
    - `d$` or `D`: Delete to end of line
    - `d0`: Delete to beginning of line
    - `dd`: Delete entire line
    - `cw`: Change word (delete and enter insert mode)
    - `cb`: Change backward word
    - `ce`: Change to end of word
    - `c$` or `C`: Change to end of line
    - `c0`: Change to beginning of line
    - `cc`: Change entire line
    - `x`: Delete character under cursor
    - `X`: Delete character before cursor

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 2: Advanced navigation - `gg`, `G`, `Ctrl-d/u`, `H/M/L`, `{/}`
    Day 1: Basic movement - `w`, `b`, `e`, `0`, `$`

Your tasks:
1. Delete unnecessary words using dw
2. Change incorrect values using cw
3. Delete entire lines using dd
4. Use D and C for line-end operations
5. Clean up code using various delete/change commands
