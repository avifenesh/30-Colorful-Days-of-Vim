/*
Welcome to Day 3 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll focus on yanking (copying) and putting (pasting) text.

New keys for today:
    - `yy`: Yank (copy) the current line.
    - `p`: Put (paste) the yanked text after the cursor.
    - `P`: Put (paste) the yanked text before the cursor.
    - `yw`: Yank from the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
    - `yb`: Yank from the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.
    - `ye`: Yank from the cursor to the end of the current word.
    - `y$`: Yank from the cursor to the end of the line.
    - `y0`: Yank from the cursor to the beginning of the line.

Reminder from Day 2:
    - `dw`, `cw` for deleting and changing words.

Your tasks:
1.  Yank the line with the comment "// TASK 1" and put it below the line with the comment "// TASK 2".
2.  In the line with the comment "// TASK 3", yank the word "Rust" and put it at the end of the line.

fn main() {
    // TASK 1: Yank this line.
    println!("Vim challenge Day 3!");
    // TASK 2: Put the yanked line below this one.

    // TASK 3: This is a line of Rust code.
}
