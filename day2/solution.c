    - `dw`: Delete from the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
    - `db`: Delete from the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.
    - `de`: Delete from the cursor to the end of the current word.
    - `d$`: Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.
    - `d0`: Delete from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
    - `cw`: Change from the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
    - `cb`: Change from the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.
    - `ce`: Change from the cursor to the end of the current word.
    - `c$`: Change from the cursor to the end of the line.

Reminder from Day 1:
    - `w`, `b`, `e`, `0`, `$` for movement.

Your tasks:
1.  In the line with the comment "// TASK 1", delete the word "extra".
2.  In the line with the comment "// TASK 2", change the word "wrong" to "right".
3.  In the line with the comment "// TASK 3", delete the second sentence.
