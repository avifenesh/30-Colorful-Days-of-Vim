/*
Welcome to Day 22 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `:lvim`: Populate the location list with errors from a specific file.
    - `:lopen`: Open the location window.
    - `:lclose`: Close the location window.
    - `:lnext`: Go to the next error in the location list.
    - `:lprev`: Go to the previous error in the location list.

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 21: Quickfix - `:make`, `:copen`, `:cn`, `:cp` (location list is similar!)
    Day 20: Argument list - `:args`, `:next` (process multiple files)
    Day 13: Windows - `:split`, `:vsplit`, `Ctrl-w w` (view lists alongside code)
    Day 12: Global commands - `:g/error/` (find all errors)
    Day 11: Marks - `ma`, `'a` (mark error locations)


Your tasks:
1.  Populate the location list with errors from `lesson.js` (simulated).
2.  Open the location list.
3.  Navigate through the errors.
