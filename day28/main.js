/*
Welcome to Day 28 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `:!command`: Execute an external command.
    - `:r!command`: Read the output of an external command into the buffer.
    - `:w !command`: Write the buffer to an external command's stdin.
    - `!{motion}command`: Filter a motion through an external command.
    - `!{range}command`: Filter a range through an external command.

Reminder from Day 27:
    - Global command and ranges (`:g`, `:s`).


Your tasks:
1.  Insert the current date and time into the file using an external command.
2.  Sort the lines with the comments "// SORT ME" using an external command.
