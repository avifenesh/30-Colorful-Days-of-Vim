/*
Welcome to Day 25 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about the jump list.

New concepts for today:
    - `Ctrl-o`: Go to older position in the jump list.
    - `Ctrl-i`: Go to newer position in the jump list.
    - `:jumps`: Show the jump list.

Reminder from Day 24:
    - Change list (`g;`, `g,`).

Your tasks:
1.  Make several jumps (e.g., `G`, `gg`, `/search`, `fx`).
2.  Use `Ctrl-o` and `Ctrl-i` to navigate through the jump list.
3.  View the jump list using `:jumps`.
