/*
Welcome to Day 8 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about jumping to specific lines and characters.

New keys for today:
    - `G`: Go to the last line of the file.
    - `gg`: Go to the first line of the file.
    - `5G`: Go to line 5.
    - `fx`: Jump to the next occurrence of the character 'x' on the current line.
    - `Fx`: Jump to the previous occurrence of the character 'x' on the current line.
    - `tx`: Jump to just before the next occurrence of the character 'x' on the current line.
    - `Tx`: Jump to just after the previous occurrence of the character 'x' on the current line.
    - `;`: Repeat the last f, F, t, or T command.
    - `,`: Repeat the last f, F, t, or T command in the opposite direction.

Reminder from Day 7:
    - `/` and `?` for searching, `n` and `N` for navigating matches.

Your tasks:
1.  Go to the last line of the file.
2.  Go to the first line of the file.
3.  Go to the line with the comment "// TASK 1".
4.  On the line with the comment "// TASK 2", jump to the character 'p' and replace it with 'P'.
