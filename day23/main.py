"""
Welcome to Day 23 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `g-`: Undo older changes.
    - `g+`: Redo newer changes.
    - `:earlier 1h`: Go back 1 hour in undo history.
    - `:later 30m`: Go forward 30 minutes in undo history.

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 22: Location list - `:lopen`, `:lnext`, `:lprev` (per-window quickfix)
    Day 17: Registers - `"0p` (paste last yank, not affected by deletes)
    Day 11: Marks - `` `. `` (jump to last change), `` `' `` (line of last change)
    Day 4: Repeat - `.` (repeat last change), `u` (undo), `Ctrl-r` (redo)
    Day 2: Change - `ciw`, `cc` (make changes to track in undo tree)


Your tasks:
1.  Make several changes to the file (e.g., add/delete lines).
2.  Use `g-` and `g+` to navigate through the undo tree.
3.  Use `:earlier` and `:later` to jump to specific points in time.
