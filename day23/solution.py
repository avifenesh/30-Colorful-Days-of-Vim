"""
Welcome to Day 23 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about the undo tree.

New concepts for today:
    - `g-`: Undo older changes.
    - `g+`: Redo newer changes.
    - `:earlier 1h`: Go back 1 hour in undo history.
    - `:later 30m`: Go forward 30 minutes in undo history.

Reminder from Day 22:
    - Location list (`:lvim`, `:lopen`).

Your tasks:
1.  Make several changes to the file (e.g., add/delete lines).
2.  Use `g-` and `g+` to navigate through the undo tree.
3.  Use `:earlier` and `:later` to jump to specific points in time.
