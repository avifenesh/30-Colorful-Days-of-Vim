/*
Welcome to Day 14 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about auto-completion and snippets.

New concepts for today:
    - `Ctrl-n` and `Ctrl-p`: Cycle through auto-completion suggestions.
    - Snippets: (This is more about configuring your nvim, but we'll simulate it.)

Reminder from Day 13:
    - `:split`, `:vsplit`, `Ctrl-w w` for windows.

Your tasks:
1.  In the `main` function, type `print` and use `Ctrl-n` or `Ctrl-p` to complete it to `printf`.
2.  Simulate a snippet: Replace `// SNIPPET_START` with a `for` loop that iterates from `i = 0` to `9`.

    printf("Vim challenge Day 14!\n"); // TASK 1:
    // TASK 2: 
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // Your code here
    }
    return 0;
}
