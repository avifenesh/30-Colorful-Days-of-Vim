/*
Welcome to Day 9 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about macros.

New keys for today:
    - `qa`: Start recording a macro into register 'a'.
    - `q`: Stop recording a macro.
    - `@a`: Execute the macro in register 'a'.
    - `@@`: Repeat the last executed macro.

Reminder from Day 8:
    - `G`, `gg`, `fx`, `tx` for jumping.

Your tasks:
1.  Record a macro that adds a semicolon at the end of a line.
2.  Execute the macro on the lines with the comments "// TASK 1", "// TASK 2", and "// TASK 3".

fn main() {
    println!("Vim challenge Day 9!") // TASK 1
    let x = 5 // TASK 2
    let y = 10 // TASK 3
}
