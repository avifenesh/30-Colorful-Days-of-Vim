Welcome to Day 24 of your Vim challenge!

New concepts for today:
    - `g;`: Go to the next change in the change list.
    - `g,`: Go to the previous change in the change list.

REMINDERS - Keys from previous days:
    Day 23: Undo tree - `g-` (older), `g+` (newer), `:earlier`, `:later`
    Day 11: Marks - `` `. `` (last change position), `` `' `` (last change line)
    Day 10: Marks - `''` (jump back to position before last jump)
    Day 8: Macros - `qa` (record changes), `@a` (replay changes)
    Day 6: Visual mode - `gv` (reselect last visual selection)


Your tasks:
1.  Make several changes to the file (e.g., add/delete lines, modify text).
2.  Use `g;` and `g,` to navigate through the change list.
