Welcome to Day 24 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about the change list.

New concepts for today:
    - `g;`: Go to the next change in the change list.
    - `g,`: Go to the previous change in the change list.

Reminder from Day 23:
    - Undo tree (`g-`, `g+`, `:earlier`, `:later`).

Your tasks:
1.  Make several changes to the file (e.g., add/delete lines, modify text).
2.  Use `g;` and `g,` to navigate through the change list.
