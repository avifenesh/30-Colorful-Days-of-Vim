/*
Welcome to Day 10 of your Vim challenge!

Today, we'll learn about working with multiple files.

New commands for today:
    - `:e <filename>`: Open a file for editing.
    - `:ls`: List all open buffers.
    - `:b <buffer_number>`: Switch to a specific buffer.
    - `:bn`: Switch to the next buffer.
    - `:bp`: Switch to the previous buffer.

Reminder from Day 9:
    - `qa` to record a macro, `@a` to execute.

Your tasks:
1.  Open the file `file2.js`.
2.  Copy the line from `file2.js` and paste it into `lesson.js` below the line with the comment "// TASK 1".
3.  Switch back to `file2.js` and close it.
*/

// TASK 1: Paste the line from file2.js below this line.
console.log("This line should be copied.");

console.log("Vim challenge Day 10!");
